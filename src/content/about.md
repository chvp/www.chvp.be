title = "About me"
+++

I am a PhD student at Ghent University working on
[Dodona](https://dodona.ugent.be/en). My main side project is
[Accentor](https://github.com/accentor), a self-hosted music server. I am
passionate about NixOS and general open-source development. My hobbies also
include listening to music, going to concerts, reading, long-distance running
and playing board games and TTRPGs. In the remaining time I volunteer for the
Red Cross. (And also sleep at some point.)
