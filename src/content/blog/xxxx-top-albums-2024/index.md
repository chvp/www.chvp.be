Like [in 2023](@/blog/0003-top-albums-2023/index.md), I listened to a lot of new music in 2024.
This is a list of some of my favourite albums from last year.
It's in alphabetical order, because actually ranking albums is very hard when they're very different styles.
I tried to write something about each album, but mostly it's just that I like the music.
